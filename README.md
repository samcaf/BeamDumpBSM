# BSM BeamDump
Set of Mathematica code for generating cross sections involving BSM particle production at a high-energy beam dump.


## Setup

### Mathematica Setup

The generation of FeynArts and UFO files from the FeynRules `.fr` file included in `FeynRules/models/` is automated in `FeynRules/model_generation/feynrules_to_models.nb`, and is designed with user-specified directories for Mathematica, FeynArts, and MadGraph5 in mind. In order use the automated setup, you will need to change The following directories to directories associated with your machine:
    * The directories specified in `setup/directories.m` in the "User-Specific Directories" section;
    * the path `Path/To/setup/directories.m` at the top of `FeynRules/model_generation/feynrules_to_models.nb` (and similarly for the FeynArts/FeynCalc calculations in the `calculations` folder, if you wish to use them);
    * the path `Path/To/FeynRules/UFO_output/combined_beamdump/vertices.py` in `FeynRules/model_generation/add_formfactors_UFO_vertices.py`.

### Generating Models
In order to generate the models we use for our beam dump analyses, simply run the notebook `FeynRules/feynrules_to_models.nb` (after setting up the directories you are using in `setup/directories.m`). This notebook uses the model `combined_beamdump.fr` in the `Feynrules/models/` folder to generate FeynArts and UFO files for use in computations; it also moves them to the FeynArts and MG5 directories designed for model storage automatically.

### Additional Setup
If you want to use the UFO model files generated by `FeynRules/feynrules_to_models.nb` in conjunction with MadGraph5 -- the relevant UFO files are moved to the specified MadGraph5 directories automatically -- you will need to convert the model from the default python2 format to the python3 format used by the most recent version of MadGraph5. I find it easiest to allow MadGraph to take care of this automatically:
```
./Path/to/MadGraph5/bin/mg5_aMC
set auto_convert_model True
```
